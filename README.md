# WijmoVue
Wijmo 5 components for VueJS (grid, chart, gauge, inputs)..

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/) is a JavaScript application framework
similar to Angular and React, but simpler and lighter.
Vue 1.0.25 is less than 80k of minified JavaScript. Angular 1.5.6 and React 15.1.0 
are both about twice that size.

Despite its tiny footprint, Vue is very powerful and flexible. You can see how it
compares with some other popular JavaScript frameworks
[here](https://vuejs.org/guide/comparison.html).

Wijmo is also compact, powerful and flexible. The two libraries are a great match.

This sample shows how you can easily encapsulate Wijmo controls into Vue components.
It has a main component that contains some random data, and several Wijmo-based 
components bound to the same data. If you use any control to modify the data, the
changes are automatically reflected on all other controls on the page.
